# Geogebra Calculus Resources

A collection of Geogebra sheets I made for some calculus courses I taught at City Lit. Some were made interactively during class and are a bit scruffy. A few took some real effort to get working. This is just an archive but if you're trying to figure out how to make educational visualizations like the one below, there may be some useful things to steal here.
